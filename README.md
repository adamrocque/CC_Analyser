# CC_Analyser
A script to automatically analyze credit card statements and tell me what I've been spending on

This script requires the data to be given in .csv format for now, though there may be eventual methods / work for converting things. Moreover, currently this is all done through dictionaries of transactions that I've pre-sorted. Eventually I would like to enable the script to prompt the user to sort unknown transactions that it encounters into categories that are useful. Perhaps I would also include the ability to create more categories? Though we're thinking quite a bit ahead at this point.
